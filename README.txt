Project Title: 
TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

Motivation:
This project was created as a demonstration of basic Python GUI programming using the standard library, Tkinter. The goal was to build a fully functional, self-contained, single and multiplayer game application that adheres to the classic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Data Description:
While this specific project is a GUI application and does not manage external datasets, all game-state data (the 3x3 board array, player turn, and score count) is handled in-memory within the main Python script (e.g., 'tictactoe.py'). There are no external data files required.

How to Use:

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

Locate the main game script (main.py)

The game window will open automatically. Click on the squares to play.

Notes:

The GUI is built using standard Tkinter widgets, making it highly portable across different operating systems that support Python.

This application does not require any third-party dependencies.
